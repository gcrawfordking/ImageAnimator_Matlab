There are two version of the application. To run, run the 'main.m' file in the directory.

- The folder named "LP Album GUI" runs the GUI animation with album covers, with objects that display information when clicked. Objects move in vertical, diagonal, and horizontal directions. This version of the application was meant to serve as a way to browse for items online. 

- The folder named "Animation Generator" contains an application that makes animations based on a background image and input images that are segmented, to extract an object of interest. Objects move in sinusoidal motion. There is a userform that allows for the adjustment of run parameters, and option to output an .avi movie file rather than displaying a GUI. The output .avi file will play on Windows OS but may need to be converted to another format to play on Mac OSX. Video writes for 1000 iterations at frame rate of 60.

- A folder called "Sample Pictures" contains some images to be used in animations in the "Animation Generator". A folder called "Sample Backgrounds" contains images that can be used as backgrounds in the animations.
